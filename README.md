# What? 

This is a Java refactoring practice project. It is a *Conway's-game-of-life-on-command-line-program*.

It is written in such a way that it really needs some refactoring. The production code is hard to read and hard to maintain. Feature by feature has been added without ever improving on the existing code base. Real world bad practice&trade;.

Luckily this project has a quite good test suite of jUnit 4 tests. Further, the test cases do test the GameOfLife program as a whole, so the internal design of the production code is not locked down by the test cases.


## Using the code

The code to improve is in the **src**-folder. The tests are in the **test**-folder.

### Good to know

* The project is a Eclipse project.
* It uses Java 8.

### Getting started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Import into Eclipse or squeeze it into your favorite IDE.
3. Practice your refactoring magic.

### Other practice scenario A

Improve performance. Do you know your performance profiler? Is it possible to improve the performance by a factor 10? There are some performance tests in class *gol.performance.PerformanceTest*. 

### Other practice scenario B

Add new features to the program. A new feature could be to read and write [the RLE-format](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Run_Length_Encoded) or [some other file format](http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Category:File_formats).



## Using the GameOfLife program

Use the flag **-?** to display usage help.

>    **`$ java gol.Main -?`**

>     Help requested
>      
>     Usage
>      java gol.Main [ARGUMENTS...]
>     
>      arguments:
>        -?              Prints this usage help.
>        -w <WIDTH>      Width of simulation view port. Default is 20.
>        -h <HEIGHT>     Height of simulation view port. Default is 15.
>        -f <FILE_PATH>  File with start state. Default is a random start state.
>        -@              Use spaced '@' and '.' instead of default '#' and '-'.
>        -O              Use 'O' instead of default '#'.
>        -s <STEPS>      Number of maximum generation steps. Default is 100.
>        -l <X>          Detect loops of maximum length x. Default is 0 - no loop detection.
>        -t <MS>         Time delay (ms) to wait between each step. Default is 0 ms.
>        -q              Quiet mode. Only outputs the last step in a simulation. Ignores time delay.

  
	
The following set of arguments would result in a 1000 steps simulation, detecting loops of max length 200, with view port size of 70x40, using @-signs for displaying cells and using a 150 ms delay between each simulation step.

>    **`$ java gol.Main -s 1000 -l 200 -w 70 -h 40 -@ -t 150`**

The default values also work fine. If running from the project root folder, use class path.

>   **`$ java -cp bin/ gol.Main`**

There are some example start states in the **examples**-folder in the project root. One of these is a 100-steps oscillator called *centinal*.

>   **`$ java -cp bin/ gol.Main -f examples/centinal -t 100 -O`**
